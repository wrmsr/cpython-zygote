- pre-toucher / ideally modify page flags to let it happen naturally in fork()
- /proc smaps + pagemap

- graceful fallback cfg'd in py, already available in ctypes.pythonapi
- mallocstat can tell which arenas are pinned in py
- port Py_PINNED to py
- track parent [well, root really] pid in zygote, pagemaps can tell which were hit
- ... only things allocated are arenas, maintain freelist
 - sort and shrink
  - naw just double LL, choose least
- pinstate to just a bool? can pin if contig?
** count PyObject_Malloc fallbacks
 - fork friendly malloc? alloc all holes?
- Memory mappings that have been marked with the madvise(2) MADV_DONTFORK flag are not inherited across a fork().
- configurable bump allocation (for both pymalloc and jemalloc) - uh wow pin use remaining pinned space :||||
- jemalloc just reinit, fuck freeing
