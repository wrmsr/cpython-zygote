- l3 sharing
- page analyzer
- pre-toucher / ideally modify page flags to let it happen naturally in fork()
- /proc smaps + pagemap
- graceful fallback cfg'd in py, already available in ctypes.pythonapi
- mallocstat can tell which arenas are pinned in py
- port Py_PINNED to py
- track parent [well, root really] pid in zygote, pagemaps can tell which were hit
- ... only things allocated are arenas, maintain freelist
 - sort and shrink
  - naw just double LL, choose least
 - fork friendly malloc? alloc all holes?
- Memory mappings that have been marked with the madvise(2) MADV_DONTFORK flag are not inherited across a fork().
- configurable bump allocation (for both pymalloc and jemalloc) - uh wow pin use remaining pinned space :||||
- jemalloc just reinit, fuck freeing

* TODO allocation context struct - threadlocal
- mp [billiard] worker pool, zmq pool

gc.unpinned thread-local | ctxmgr, unpinned arena

 ./configure --enable-unicode=ucs4

*** failure to import is likely caused by missing __init__.py in parent dirs
 - *** strace grep .pth - site is fuxcked
  - site.py is customized on debian :|

break import_submodule if strcmp(fullname, "zope") == 0

worker release policies - rss, time, reqs, blah
 - PSS

- can cheaply estimate private usage from unpinned pymalloc and jemalloc arenas, can supplement with dirty map
- dirtymap bitvec? rtree? compressed bitmap per map?
- ... wsgi over zmq, load balance, can use hybrid thread/process model....
- become user for interactive via sec cred
- look at other dynamic threadpool impls
- nesting... call pin multiple times from different tree lineages, keep allocating contig until sealed..
